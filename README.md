## Directory Structure

-   `intro-to-dplyr/`: Contains files for the first half of the workshop, focusing on data manipulation using dplyr

-   `intro-to-ggplot2/`: Contains files for the second half of the workshop, covering basic data visualization with ggplot2

-   `more-ggplot2/`: Includes additional code that we probably won't have time to cover during the workshop but is helpful for further learning

## During the workshop

-   In each of the above folders, you'll find a `.qmd` file with `_blank` in its name. If you'd like to **code along**, you can use these files, which provide skeletons for you to fill in as we work through the material.

-   If you prefer to **follow along without coding**, open the other `.qmd` file that already contains all the code.

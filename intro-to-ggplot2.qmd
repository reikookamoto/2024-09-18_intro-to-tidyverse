## üé®Introduction to ggplot2

ggplot2 helps us create a wide range of static, informative, and visually appealing graphics. Its name comes from the Grammar of Graphics, which is a framework for building plots in a structured way. We can build a plot incrementally by adding layers like data points, axes, colours, and labels.

üíªLoad the necessary packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

## 1Ô∏è‚É£Explore the sample data

We'll use a data set sourced from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-26), which originally retrieved the data from the SNCF open data portal. SCNF, founded in 1938, is France's national railway company. It operates systems like the TGV high-speed trains and regional TER services.

üíªRead in the data using the [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function from the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package:

```{r}
trains_df <- read_csv("french_trains.csv")
trains_df
```

üß†Explore the type and description of each variable:

| Variable                  | Type      | Description                          |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| `year`                    | double    | Year of observation                  |
| `month`                   | double    | Month of obsrevation                 |
| `service`                 | character | Type of service                      |
| `departure_station`       | character | Departure station                    |
| `arrival_station`         | character | Arrival station                      |
| `journey_time_avg`        | double    | Average journey time (in minutes)    |
| `total_num_trips`         | double    | Total number of trips recorded       |
| `avg_delay_all_departing` | double    | Average departure delay (in minutes) |
| `avg_delay_all_arriving`  | double    | Average arrival delay (in minutes)   |
| `num_late_at_departure`   | double    | Number of trains that departed late  |
| `num_arriving_late`       | double    | Number of trains that arrived late   |

The data set contains **monthly summaries** train journeys from 2015 to 2018. Each row represents aggregated data for a specific route and month, including average journey times, delays, and the total number of trips. This structure will allow us to explore trends over time and visualize overall patterns in travel travel.

üíªInspect the first and last parts of the data set:

```{r}
head(trains_df)
tail(trains_df)
```

-   The first row captures information on trips from **AIX EN PROVENCE TGV** to **PARIS LYON** for the month of **JANUARY 2015**

-   The last row captures information on trips from **ZURICH** to **PARIS LYON** for the month of **NOVEMBER 2018**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£Histograms

üíªCreate a histogram to visualize the distribution of average journey time:

```{r}
ggplot(trains_df, aes(x = journey_time_avg)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```

We can see that the distribution of average journey time is right-skewed.

Breaking down the code:

-   The first argument in ggplot() indicates which data frame we want to use.

-   The second argument, called the aesthetic mapping, specifies how the columns of the data frame should be mapped to different parts of the plot (e.g., x-axis, y-axis, colour, etc.).

-   We use the `+` operator to add each layer to the plot.

-   `geom_histogram()` is a geometric object (or "geom") that decides how the mapped data is displayed‚Äîin this case, as a histogram.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£Scatter plots

Scatter plots are a powerful way to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.

üíªCreate a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the average journey time and the number of trains that departed late:

```{r}
trains_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = journey_time_avg, y = num_late_at_departure)) +
  geom_point()
```

Sometimes, when data points overlap too much, it can be challenging to see the individual points. This is called overplotting.

üíªTo address this, adjust the transparency of the points using the `alpha` argument:

```{r}
trains_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = journey_time_avg, y = num_late_at_departure)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

üíªMake the plot more visually appealing by changing the colour of the points and adding a title and axis labels:

```{r}
trains_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = journey_time_avg, y = num_late_at_departure)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, colour = "#3182bd") +
  labs(
    title = "French train punctuality",
    x = "Average journey time (in minutes)",
    y = "Number of trains that departed late"
  )
```

#### üìù**Exercise 1**

Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two other continuous variables in the data. This time, change the default size of the points by using the `size` argument. The default size is 1.5, but we can increase or decrease this value to make the points bigger or smaller.

```{r}
trains_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_num_trips, y = num_late_at_departure)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.1)
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£Bar plots 

Bar plots are also commonly used in data analysis. They are particular useful for comparing values between different groups.

üíªCreate a bar plot to show the number of departures from "PARIS NORD" in 2015 by arrival station:

```{r}
trains_df |> 
  filter(departure_station == "PARIS NORD",
         year == 2015) |> 
  group_by(arrival_station) |> 
  summarise(n = sum(total_num_trips)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_station, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Here, `stat = "identity"` tells ggplot2 to take the `n` column as it is and use it for the height of the bars.

üíªCreate a grouped bar plot to compare the number of departures from "PARIS NORD" in 2015 and 2015, by arrival station:

```{r}
bar_plot <- trains_df |> 
  filter(departure_station == "PARIS NORD", 
         year %in% c(2015, 2016)) |>
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) |> 
  group_by(year, arrival_station) |> 
  summarise(n = sum(total_num_trips), .groups = "drop") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_station, y = n, fill = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

-   `as.factor(year)` changes the `year` variable from a numeric type to a categorical one, ensuring each year gets a distinct colour

-   `fill` argument in `aes()` maps the `year` variable to the fill colour of the bars

-   `position = "dodge"` arranges the bars of the different years side by side within each `arrival_station` category, making it easier to compare values across years

üíªCustomize fill colours manually:

```{r}
bar_plot +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("2015" = "gold", "2016" = "royalblue"))
```

Pre-made colour palettes, such as those from the [RColorBrewer](https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html) package, offer a variety of well-tested colour schemes that are often aesthetically pleasing. These palettes are useful for ensuring good contrast and consistency across visualizations.

üíªDisplay available palettes:

```{r}
display.brewer.all()
```

üíªPick and apply a qualitative palette from RColorBrewer:

```{r}
bar_plot +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

In ggplot2, the `scale_{aesthetic}_{type}()` functions control how data values are mapped to aesthetic properties like colour and fill.

The `scale_fill_{type}()` functions adjust fill colours in plots where the `fill` aesthetic is mapped to a variable, such as in bar and box plots.

On the other hand, `scale_colour_{type}()` functions are used to adjust the colours of lines, points, or borders in plots where the `colour` aesthetic is mapped to a variable.

#### üìùExercise 2

Create a bar plot to show the number of departures from "NANTES" in 2018 by arrival station. Use the `scale_fill_brewer()` function to apply a qualitative palette accessible to colorblind viewers. Hint: You can call `display.brewer.allcolorblindFriendly=TRUE)` to retrieve a list of appropriate palettes.

```{r}
trains_df |> 
  filter(departure_station == "NANTES",
         year == 2018) |> 
  group_by(arrival_station) |> 
  summarise(n = sum(total_num_trips)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_station, y = n, fill = arrival_station)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")
```
